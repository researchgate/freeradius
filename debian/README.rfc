These are the relevant RFC's that normally ship with freeradius.  However,
we have now decided that useful things like RFC's are not free enough, and
so we can't ship them in Debian main.  They are all available from the
original freeradius tarball, available at
ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/radius/
and from
http://www.rfc-editor.org/

Sorry for the inconvenience.
